                                (F21) "Hey guys. 
                                So I met a very good looking guy online and we instantly clicked,we met in person and everything went well but what‚Äôs crazy is that he wanted to sleep with me the same day that we met and I thought to myself ‚Äúthat‚Äôs crazy‚Äù but I did not want to ruin everything buy saying something bad or yelling at him so I just lied to him that I‚Äôm on my period. A few minutes later the ohn started acting like his friends were calling him to go get stuff and what not ‚ÄúI knew it was just a way of just leaving‚Äù then I was like cool.
                                Fast forward me and this guy were now in a situationship and we did what couples do cute stuff,we shared good moments together and it was all good but he was always asking for money and I gave him when I had it,this guy never gave me any money from the time we started talking till the time we broke up.
                                He loved sex man all the damn time it was just sex and I got tired of it,I decided to minimize man because wtfff.
                                So then this boy became cold towards me just a few days after I stopped giving him money and sex üòÇ he then started hanging with different girls and posting them then I just knew they are probably in the same situation so then he would constantly get mad at me easily or some shit and gaslighting me blah blah blah so I left him.
                                That‚Äôs when I learnt that an Exsay is an Exsay with the dads car and and iPhone 12 kaya ngati ni 13 but never has money for gas or bundles.
                                After this experience I was broken and depressed cause he even used my mental health issues against me,I realized they I opened up to an idiot 
                                And yes I‚Äôm the stupid one for Ignoring the red flags the first day we met.
                                I don‚Äôt blame him tho I have a nice body time time and I gave him access üò≠üòÇ
                                Elo niwapa unza mambala uja I wish I could expose him so that people can stay wokeü§ß"

                                Despite Renting Zambian Millionaire Spends over K120 000 in servicing Car.
                                        Unlike Most Zambians who will prefer building their houses first before Driving
                                        anything that moves, Chanda Brain a Lusaka Bussiness man and millionaire spent
                                        over K120 000 just to Service and Repair his Mercedes Benz.
                                        Also among the list of Zambia's fast growing millionaires and uninspired or
                                        moved by chellah tukuta and his house building campaign Brian Chanda Innovation
                                        Would rather face his landlord man to man like the stubborn honey Badger and pay
                                        Rentals day in and day but he should have his Mercedes Benz in a perfect
                                        condition.
                                        Meanwhile despite being rich at a young age,and now Mr Chanda is a fully grown
                                        man who is capable of impregnating anything that moves, the millionaire is still
                                        lonely and single like a pangolin.
                                        The Millionaire was last year dumped by his coloured of a girlfriend jasmine who
                                        packed her Nakonde pitcots and Bra's, moved out of his house and she went
                                        straight to kitwe for possible marriage with a Jerabo, because Jerabos are
                                        stubbornly known for Marrying nothing but coloureds as a sign of archivement.
                                        Miss jasmine stressed out that the millionaire became violent like a pregnant
                                        kangaroo in Australia and she was left with no option but to leave him.

                                I'm so disturbed right now and I don't know what to do
                                Last year a friend (male) invited me over for dinner then we later on proceeded to
                                drinking with his friends (both male and female). We had alot to drink that night so I
                                got too wasted and I crashed at his house. I left following day and he later called and
                                said I needed to a pill. I was so confused because I couldn't recall having raw sex with
                                him, the only thing I could remember was him kissing me and getting on top of me and I
                                blacked out.
                                It was too late for the pill because I already ovulated so I got pregnant and he
                                insisted I do an abortion. I wasn't sure of what I wanted but I wasn't ready to have a
                                child with someone I have no emotional connection with so I agreed. He bought the pills
                                and I took but didn't bleed on the first day, second day the flow was just normal like
                                periods. I thought it was normal because the pregnancy was approximately two weeks old.
                                The same year I had raw sex with my man and I was 100% sure I was going to be pregnant
                                but to my surprise I wasn't. I thought it was just luck. A week ago I had raw sex with
                                my man a and I was sure I was going to be pregnant but I have seen my periods. This
                                clearly indicates that I am now barrenüò≠üò≠üò≠"

                                        Please post this one, its very alarming. it's very important I alert my fellow females
                                because this ohn is bad news.
                                There is this small, skinny guy from the unilus law campus under distance learning and
                                is found either at leopards rest or in bauleni. This guy is always fucking girls raw and
                                goes on to spread his disability to other girls at either Unza or nipa or mulungushi.
                                His two girlfriends busted him over the weekend and I was also contacted. Busy taking me
                                out not knowing that our dates and nights out were being sponsored by his other
                                girlfriend. I‚Äôm even scared to go for vct because I fear he may have infected me with
                                something because he never used protection with either of them too and he‚Äôs been
                                sleeping with several other girls and is busy giving them fima sti‚Äôs and yet he can‚Äôt
                                fuck. Please be careful with this ka Corolla driving guy who clearly thinks with from
                                his balls!"

                                        I really need help I'm dying inside emotionally and physically
                                        I have met this guy and I think he's the one the guy loves me,we are both law
                                        students in the same year. This guy is different he wants nothing to do with my
                                        body and wants to wait until marriage before having $3x which I admire but due
                                        to a traumatic event I got r*ped by a guy I trusted the most from that time I've
                                        developed an addiction which I've been working on but it's really hard for me.
                                        I want to open up and tell him about my addiction but I'm scared of how he may
                                        react I don't want him to think I'm sleeping around or I like doing it. It's
                                        been long since I got intimate n I'm perfectly healthy but I find myself
                                        m*st*rbating which I don't want to do
                                        I really need help how can I tell him about everything without making it seem
                                        like I'm a hule and someone I call for therapy cause it's too much I don't want
                                        to end up depressed n later on committing su*c*de "

                                (F22)
                                Ok so my dad died in 2011 and my mother remarried 4 years later in 2015. She
                                was 39 at the time and he was 35. Before they got married, she'd always
                                complain about his infidelity. We'd even call her a cougar because he'd
                                always just ask her for money and manipulate her into thinking she actually
                                wanted to marry him( as a joke ofcourse). Once they got married, he moved in
                                with us. From then, my mum forbid us from ever talking about our biological
                                dad in the house, it got to the point where my mum even almost made cut ties
                                with our dad's side of the family. My mum's new husband would always look at
                                my sister and I in funny ways. Not gonna lie, he was good looking eish man.
                                One day I walked in on him in the bathroom with a hard on. Imwe his cock was
                                throbbing and I could tell he needed some help. He tried to resist at first
                                but we ended up fucking. Mind you this was in 2021 I waw 20 at the time. We
                                were all alone in the house and we basically fucked for the most part of the
                                day. We pretended like everything was normal when everyone got back home. He
                                really fucked the daylights out of me but I vowed to never do that again.
                                Till this day he still makes advances to try and fuck me. He slaps my ass
                                whenever he sees me and he gives me money and anything that I want. I don't
                                feel bad about it though cause I feel like mu mum deserves it for trying to
                                make my siblings and I forget all about our dad. I might even fuck him
                                again,who knows"

                                        It will be resolved quickly and peacefully.

                                        It will be resolved but only after much arguing.

                                        It will not be resolved‚Äã‚Äîeven after much arguing.

                                        If you can‚Äôt seem to get along with your parents, you might think they should do
                                        something to improve the situation. As we will see, however, there are steps you
                                        can take to reduce the frequency and ease the intensity of the conflicts. First,
                                        consider . . .

                                        Why conflict happens
                                        Thinking ability. As you grow up, you begin to think more deeply about things
                                        than you did when you were a child. You also start forming strong
                                        convictions‚Äã‚Äîsome of which might be at odds with those of your parents.
                                        Nevertheless, the Bible says: ‚ÄúHonor your father and your mother.‚Äù‚Äã‚ÄîExodus
                                        20:12.

                                        Fact of life: It takes maturity and skill to disagree without being
                                        disagreeable.

                                        Independence. As you mature, your parents will likely grant you greater freedom.
                                        The problem is, it might not be as much freedom as you want or as soon as you
                                        want it‚Äã‚Äîand that can lead to conflict. Nevertheless, the Bible says: ‚ÄúBe
                                        obedient to your parents.‚Äù‚Äã‚ÄîEphesians 6:1.

                                        Fact of life: Often, how much freedom your parents grant you depends on how you
                                        handle the freedom you already have.

                                        What you can do
                                        Focus on your role. Instead of putting the entire blame on your parents for a
                                        conflict, consider what you can do to make peace. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not always what your
                                        parents say but how you respond that adds to a conflict,‚Äù says a young man named
                                        Jeffrey. ‚ÄúSpeaking calmly goes a long way toward smoothing things over.‚Äù

                                        The Bible says: ‚ÄúAs far as it depends on you, be peaceable.‚Äù‚Äã‚ÄîRomans 12:18.

                                        Listen. ‚ÄúI find that this is the hardest thing to do,‚Äù admits 17-year-old
                                        Samantha. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôve also found that when parents see that you‚Äôre listening,
                                        chances are they‚Äôll listen to you.‚Äù

                                        The Bible says: ‚ÄúBe quick to listen, slow to speak.‚Äù‚Äã‚ÄîJames 1:19.

                                        1. A frying pan on a stovetop catches on fire; 2. The fire rages out of control
                                        Conflict is like a fire‚Äã‚Äîif it is not contained, it may rage out of control

                                        Think like a teammate. Approach a conflict as you would a sport, such as a
                                        tennis match. But put the issue‚Äã‚Äînot your parents‚Äã‚Äîon the other side of the net.
                                        ‚ÄúIn a conflict, parents want what they think is best for their teenager and the
                                        teenager wants what he thinks is best for himself,‚Äù says a young man named Adam.
                                        ‚ÄúSo, at least in theory, they‚Äôre working for the same goal.‚Äù

                                        The Bible says: ‚ÄúPursue the things making for peace.‚Äù‚Äã‚ÄîRomans 14:19.

                                        Be understanding. ‚ÄúI find it helpful to remember that parents have to struggle
                                        with their own issues, which are often just as menacing as ours,‚Äù says a
                                        teenager named Sarah. A young woman named Carla takes it further. ‚ÄúI try to put
                                        myself in my parents‚Äô position,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúWhat would it be like for me if I
                                        were raising a child and dealing with the same situation? What would be in the
                                        best interests of my child?‚Äù

                                        The Bible says: ‚ÄúLook out not only for your own interests, but also for the
                                        interests of others.‚Äù‚Äã‚ÄîPhilippians 2:4.

                                        Be obedient. In the end, that‚Äôs what the Bible requires you to do. (Colossians
                                        3:‚Äã20) And things will go much easier for you if you comply. ‚ÄúMy life is less
                                        stressful when I just do what my parents ask,‚Äù says a young woman named Karen.
                                        ‚ÄúThey have already sacrificed a lot for me, so it‚Äôs the least I can do.‚Äù
                                        Obedience is one of the greatest antidotes for conflict!

                                        The Bible says: ‚ÄúWhere there is no wood, the fire goes out.‚Äù‚Äã‚ÄîProverbs 26:20.

                                        Tip. If you find it difficult to communicate, try writing out your thoughts in a
                                        note or a text message. ‚ÄúI do that when I‚Äôm not in a good enough frame of mind
                                        to talk,‚Äù says a teenager named Alyssa. ‚ÄúIt helps me to express myself without
                                        yelling or saying something I‚Äôll regret later on.‚Äù

                                        Journey to Dry Nights: Overcoming Bedwetting
                                    </h5>

                                    <!-- blog half story -->
                                    <p class="card-text my-0 blog_story_half">
                                        Once upon a time, in a cozy little house, there lived a child named Alex. Alex
                                        was a bright and cheerful kid, but there was one problem that troubled them
                                        deeply ‚Äì bedwetting.

                                        Every night, like clockwork, Alex would drift off to sleep, only to wake up in a
                                        puddle of embarrassment and shame. No matter how hard they tried, they couldn't
                                        seem to stay dry through the night.

                                        One day, Alex's parents decided it was time to tackle the problem head-on. They
                                        sat down with Alex and explained that bedwetting was nothing to be ashamed of ‚Äì
                                        it was just a little hiccup that they would overcome together.

                                        First, they established a bedtime routine. Alex would drink plenty of fluids
                                        during the day but cut back in the evening. Before bed, they would make a
                                        special trip to the bathroom to empty their bladder.

                                        Next, Alex's parents invested in a magical shield to protect their bed ‚Äì a
                                        waterproof mattress cover. No longer would they have to worry about soggy sheets
                                        and damp mattresses.

                                        But the most important part of their journey was learning to listen to their
                                        body. Alex's parents encouraged them to pay attention to the signals their
                                        bladder was sending and wake up to use the bathroom during the night if needed.

                                        It wasn't easy at first. There were many nights of frustration and tears. But
                                        little by little, Alex began to make progress. They celebrated each dry night
                                        with a sticker on their chart and a big hug from Mom and Dad.

                                        And then, one magical night, it happened ‚Äì Alex woke up dry. They couldn't
                                        believe it! It was like a dream come true.

                                        From that day forward, Alex's nights were filled with sweet dreams and peaceful
                                        slumber. The bedwetting was just a distant memory, a chapter in their story of
                                        triumph and perseverance.

                                        So to all the children out there struggling with bedwetting, know that you're
                                        not alone. With patience, love, and a little bit of magic, you too can conquer
                                        the nighttime blues and wake up to dry mornings full of promise and possibility.
