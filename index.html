                                There is this small, skinny guy from the unilus law campus under distance learning and is found either at leopards rest or in bauleni. This guy is always fucking girls raw and goes on to spread his disability to other girls at either Unza or nipa or mulungushi. His two girlfriends busted him over the weekend and I was also contacted. Busy taking me out not knowing that our dates and nights out were being sponsored by his other girlfriend. I’m even scared to go for vct because I fear he may have infected me with something because he never used protection with either of them too and he’s been sleeping with several other girls and is busy giving them fima sti’s and yet he can’t fuck. Please be careful with this ka Corolla driving guy who clearly thinks with from his balls!"

                                    Hey there! I wanted to share a bit of my story with you all. You see, getting into natural sciences wasn't exactly a walk in the park for me. But with a lot of hard work and determination, I managed to clear and pursue my passion.

                                    When I first started out, I faced a lot of challenges. The coursework was tough, and there were times when I felt like I was drowning in a sea of equations and theories. But instead of giving up, I decided to buckle down and give it my all.

                                    I sought help from professors, joined study groups, and spent countless hours in the library, pouring over textbooks and taking copious notes. It wasn't easy, and there were definitely moments of doubt along the way. But I refused to let those doubts define me.

                                    Slowly but surely, things started to click. Concepts that once seemed impossibly complex began to make sense, and I found myself actually enjoying the material. I started to see progress in my grades, and that only fueled my determination to keep pushing forward.

                                    And then, finally, came the moment of truth: clearing. It was a nerve-wracking experience, waiting for the results to come in. But when I saw that I had made it through, it felt like all of my hard work had paid off.

                                    So here I am now, studying natural sciences and loving every minute of it. It hasn't been easy, but it's been worth it. And if there's one thing I've learned from this journey, it's that with enough grit and determination, anything is possible.

                                    If you're facing your own challenges right now, whether it's in academics or any other aspect of life, just know that you're not alone. Keep pushing forward, keep believing in yourself, and who knows? You might just surprise yourself with what you can achieve.

                                    I'm so disturbed right now and I don't know what to do
                                    Last year a friend (male) invited me over for dinner then we later on proceeded to drinking with his friends (both male and female). We had alot to drink that night so I got too wasted and I crashed at his house. I left following day and he later called and said I needed to a pill. I was so confused because I couldn't recall having raw sex with him, the only thing I could remember was him kissing me and getting on top of me and I blacked out. 
                                    It was too late for the pill because I already ovulated so I got pregnant and he insisted I do an abortion. I wasn't sure of what I wanted but I wasn't ready to have a child with someone I have no emotional connection with so I agreed. He bought the pills and I took but didn't bleed on the first day, second day the flow was just normal like periods. I thought it was normal because the pregnancy was approximately two weeks old. 
                                    The same year I had raw sex with my man and I was 100% sure I was going to be pregnant but to my surprise I wasn't. I thought it was just luck. A week ago I had raw sex with my man a and I was sure I was going to be pregnant but I have seen my periods. This clearly indicates that I am now barren😭😭😭"

                                            (F22)
                                            Gather 'round, folks, and let me share with you a tale of triumph over a challenge that once seemed insurmountable – the journey to stop masturbating.

                                            It all began with a realization – a moment of clarity amidst the haze of habit. I found myself trapped in a cycle of pleasure and guilt, unable to break free from the grip of temptation. Each time I promised myself it would be the last, only to find myself falling back into old patterns.

                                            But one day, something shifted within me. I looked in the mirror and saw a person longing for change, yearning for freedom from the chains that bound them. And so, with newfound resolve, I set out on a quest to reclaim control of my body and mind.

                                            The path ahead was fraught with obstacles, as I navigated the murky waters of temptation and desire. I stumbled and faltered along the way, but with each setback came a lesson learned – a piece of wisdom to guide me forward.

                                            I learned to identify my triggers – the moments of weakness that threatened to undo my progress. Whether it was stress, loneliness, or boredom, I recognized the patterns that led me astray and took steps to avoid them.

                                            I sought solace in alternative activities, channeling my energy into pursuits that nourished my soul and stimulated my mind. From painting to hiking to learning new skills, I discovered the joy of living a life filled with purpose and passion.

                                            But perhaps the most transformative aspect of my journey was learning to be kind to myself. I realized that change doesn't happen overnight, and that setbacks are a natural part of the process. Instead of berating myself for my mistakes, I chose to embrace them as opportunities for growth and self-discovery.

                                            And so, through perseverance and patience, I gradually found myself breaking free from the chains that once held me captive. With each passing day, the urge to masturbate grew weaker, until eventually, it faded into the background of my consciousness.

                                            Today, as I stand before you, I am proud to say that I have found freedom – freedom from the shackles of addiction, and freedom to live life on my own terms. My journey is far from over, but I face the road ahead with confidence and courage, knowing that I am stronger than the challenges that lie in wait.

                                            So to all those who find themselves struggling, I offer these words of encouragement: you are not alone, and you are capable of overcoming whatever obstacles stand in your way. Believe in yourself, dear friends, and never lose sight of the light that shines within you.

                                        There is this small, skinny guy from the unilus law campus under distance learning and is found either at leopards rest or in bauleni. This guy is always fucking girls raw and goes on to spread his disability to other girls at either Unza or nipa or mulungushi. His two girlfriends busted him over the weekend and I was also contacted. Busy taking me out not knowing that our dates and nights out were being sponsored by his other girlfriend. I’m even scared to go for vct because I fear he may have infected me with something because he never used protection with either of them too and he’s been sleeping with several other girls and is busy giving them fima sti’s and yet he can’t fuck. Please be careful with this ka Corolla driving guy who clearly thinks with from his balls!"

                                            I really need help I'm dying inside emotionally and physically
                                            I have met this guy and I think he's the one the guy loves me,we are both law students in the same year. This guy is different he wants nothing to do with my body and wants to wait until marriage before having $3x which I admire but due to a traumatic event I got r*ped by a guy I trusted the most from that time I've developed an addiction which I've been working on but it's really hard for me.
                                            I want to open up and tell him about my addiction but I'm scared of how he may react I don't want him to think I'm sleeping around or I like doing it. It's been long since I got intimate n I'm perfectly healthy but I find myself m*st*rbating which I don't want to do 
                                            I really need help how can I tell him about everything without making it seem like I'm a hule and someone I call for therapy cause it's too much I don't want to end up depressed n later on committing su*c*de "

                                (F22)
                                            Ok so my dad died in 2011 and my mother remarried 4 years later in 2015. She
                                            was 39 at the time and he was 35. Before they got married, she'd always
                                            complain about his infidelity. We'd even call her a cougar because he'd
                                            always just ask her for money and manipulate her into thinking she actually
                                            wanted to marry him( as a joke ofcourse). Once they got married, he moved in
                                            with us. From then, my mum forbid us from ever talking about our biological
                                            dad in the house, it got to the point where my mum even almost made cut ties
                                            with our dad's side of the family. My mum's new husband would always look at
                                            my sister and I in funny ways. Not gonna lie, he was good looking eish man.
                                            One day I walked in on him in the bathroom with a hard on. Imwe his cock was
                                            throbbing and I could tell he needed some help. He tried to resist at first
                                            but we ended up fucking. Mind you this was in 2021 I waw 20 at the time. We
                                            were all alone in the house and we basically fucked for the most part of the
                                            day. We pretended like everything was normal when everyone got back home. He
                                            really fucked the daylights out of me but I vowed to never do that again.
                                            Till this day he still makes advances to try and fuck me. He slaps my ass
                                            whenever he sees me and he gives me money and anything that I want. I don't
                                            feel bad about it though cause I feel like mu mum deserves it for trying to
                                            make my siblings and I forget all about our dad. I might even fuck him
                                            again,who knows"

 Conflict quiz
 Which parent are you most likely to have a conflict with?

 Father

 Mother

 How often do you have a conflict with that parent?

 Rarely

 Occasionally

 Frequently

 How severe is the conflict likely to be?

 It will be resolved quickly and peacefully.

 It will be resolved but only after much arguing.

 It will not be resolved​—even after much arguing.

 If you can’t seem to get along with your parents, you might think they should do something to improve the situation. As we will see, however, there are steps you can take to reduce the frequency and ease the intensity of the conflicts. First, consider . . .

 Why conflict happens
 Thinking ability. As you grow up, you begin to think more deeply about things than you did when you were a child. You also start forming strong convictions​—some of which might be at odds with those of your parents. Nevertheless, the Bible says: “Honor your father and your mother.”​—Exodus 20:12.

 Fact of life: It takes maturity and skill to disagree without being disagreeable.

 Independence. As you mature, your parents will likely grant you greater freedom. The problem is, it might not be as much freedom as you want or as soon as you want it​—and that can lead to conflict. Nevertheless, the Bible says: “Be obedient to your parents.”​—Ephesians 6:1.

 Fact of life: Often, how much freedom your parents grant you depends on how you handle the freedom you already have.

 What you can do
 Focus on your role. Instead of putting the entire blame on your parents for a conflict, consider what you can do to make peace. “It’s not always what your parents say but how you respond that adds to a conflict,” says a young man named Jeffrey. “Speaking calmly goes a long way toward smoothing things over.”

 The Bible says: “As far as it depends on you, be peaceable.”​—Romans 12:18.

 Listen. “I find that this is the hardest thing to do,” admits 17-year-old Samantha. “But I’ve also found that when parents see that you’re listening, chances are they’ll listen to you.”

 The Bible says: “Be quick to listen, slow to speak.”​—James 1:19.

1. A frying pan on a stovetop catches on fire; 2. The fire rages out of control
Conflict is like a fire​—if it is not contained, it may rage out of control

 Think like a teammate. Approach a conflict as you would a sport, such as a tennis match. But put the issue​—not your parents​—on the other side of the net. “In a conflict, parents want what they think is best for their teenager and the teenager wants what he thinks is best for himself,” says a young man named Adam. “So, at least in theory, they’re working for the same goal.”

 The Bible says: “Pursue the things making for peace.”​—Romans 14:19.

 Be understanding. “I find it helpful to remember that parents have to struggle with their own issues, which are often just as menacing as ours,” says a teenager named Sarah. A young woman named Carla takes it further. “I try to put myself in my parents’ position,” she says. “What would it be like for me if I were raising a child and dealing with the same situation? What would be in the best interests of my child?”

 The Bible says: “Look out not only for your own interests, but also for the interests of others.”​—Philippians 2:4.

 Be obedient. In the end, that’s what the Bible requires you to do. (Colossians 3:​20) And things will go much easier for you if you comply. “My life is less stressful when I just do what my parents ask,” says a young woman named Karen. “They have already sacrificed a lot for me, so it’s the least I can do.” Obedience is one of the greatest antidotes for conflict!

 The Bible says: “Where there is no wood, the fire goes out.”​—Proverbs 26:20.

 Tip. If you find it difficult to communicate, try writing out your thoughts in a note or a text message. “I do that when I’m not in a good enough frame of mind to talk,” says a teenager named Alyssa. “It helps me to express myself without yelling or saying something I’ll regret later on.”

                                        Once upon a time, in a cozy little house, there lived a child named Alex. Alex was a bright and cheerful kid, but there was one problem that troubled them deeply – bedwetting.

Every night, like clockwork, Alex would drift off to sleep, only to wake up in a puddle of embarrassment and shame. No matter how hard they tried, they couldn't seem to stay dry through the night.

One day, Alex's parents decided it was time to tackle the problem head-on. They sat down with Alex and explained that bedwetting was nothing to be ashamed of – it was just a little hiccup that they would overcome together.

First, they established a bedtime routine. Alex would drink plenty of fluids during the day but cut back in the evening. Before bed, they would make a special trip to the bathroom to empty their bladder.

Next, Alex's parents invested in a magical shield to protect their bed – a waterproof mattress cover. No longer would they have to worry about soggy sheets and damp mattresses.

But the most important part of their journey was learning to listen to their body. Alex's parents encouraged them to pay attention to the signals their bladder was sending and wake up to use the bathroom during the night if needed.

It wasn't easy at first. There were many nights of frustration and tears. But little by little, Alex began to make progress. They celebrated each dry night with a sticker on their chart and a big hug from Mom and Dad.

And then, one magical night, it happened – Alex woke up dry. They couldn't believe it! It was like a dream come true.

From that day forward, Alex's nights were filled with sweet dreams and peaceful slumber. The bedwetting was just a distant memory, a chapter in their story of triumph and perseverance.

So to all the children out there struggling with bedwetting, know that you're not alone. With patience, love, and a little bit of magic, you too can conquer the nighttime blues and wake up to dry mornings full of promise and possibility.
