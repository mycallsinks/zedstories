                                        Once upon a time in the bustling streets of Lusaka, two young men stood proud
                                        beside their gleaming Mercedes Benz cars, symbols of their hard work and
                                        success. Chanda Brina, a savvy businessman, and Yo Maps, a talented musician,
                                        had both risen from humble beginnings to become the envy of many.

                                        Chanda Brina, with his sharp business acumen, had navigated the markets
                                        dominated by white and wealthy individuals, building and selling with finesse.
                                        He had spent over a decade in university, both as a student and later as a
                                        lecturer, constantly learning and growing. Along the way, he had uplifted the
                                        lives of those around him, embodying the spirit of a true leader.

                                        Meanwhile, Yo Maps, with his soulful voice and captivating melodies, had
                                        captured the hearts of music lovers across the nation. His journey had been one
                                        of resilience and determination, overcoming obstacles with each step forward.
                                        With hits after hits, he had cemented his place in the Zambian music industry,
                                        inspiring countless young dreamers along the way.

                                        Together, these two young millionaires showcased their success with pride,
                                        standing tall beside their luxurious cars. As they posed for the camera, their
                                        smiles radiated confidence and achievement. For them, it was not just about the
                                        cars, but about the journey it took to get there.

                                        In a world where success is often equated with material wealth, Chanda Brina and
                                        Yo Maps reminded everyone that true success is built on hard work, perseverance,
                                        and a relentless pursuit of dreams. As they drove off into the sunset, their
                                        Benz cars gleaming in the sunlight, they knew that their journey was far from
                                        over. With determination in their hearts and dreams in their eyes, they were
                                        ready to conquer whatever challenges lay ahead, nothing serious for these two

                                        moved by chellah tukuta and his house building campaign Brian Chanda Innovation
                                        Would rather face his landlord man to man like the stubborn honey Badger and pay
                                        Rentals day in and day but he should have his Mercedes Benz in a perfect
                                        condition.
                                        Meanwhile despite being rich at a young age,and now Mr Chanda is a fully grown
                                        man who is capable of impregnating anything that moves, the millionaire is still
                                        lonely and single like a pangolin.
                                        The Millionaire was last year dumped by his coloured of a girlfriend jasmine who
                                        packed her Nakonde pitcots and Bra's, moved out of his house and she went
                                        straight to kitwe for possible marriage with a Jerabo, because Jerabos are
                                        stubbornly known for Marrying nothing but coloureds as a sign of archivement.
                                        Miss jasmine stressed out that the millionaire became violent like a pregnant
                                        kangaroo in Australia and she was left with no option but to leave him.

                                        opportunity. He now brags about having 21 youths working for him. Brian, the
                                        proprietor of Brian Chanda Innovations ‚Äì a clothes, shoes, cell phone and
                                        accessory store, has continued to be innovative and pushing the boundaries of
                                        what‚Äôs possible. Although he says his competitors at the moment are top brands
                                        like Mobile Monsters and Mobile City, his entrepreneurial journey is not just a
                                        tale of triumph. He shares with us some of his biggest regrets arising from his

                                        clear up the debt üòÇüòÖ I remember I even said to my self if I‚Äôll ever deal with
                                        phones am a dog üòÖ it was that bad üòÇüòÇ.

                                        Did you know that your DECISION has power to influence your PRAYER?
                                        Picture this, you pray for an A+ in the exam but you DECIDE not to take an
                                        ACTION of studying. Definitely you are not going to get that A+.
                                        Therefore, First make a DECISION to get an A+, then pray for God to enhance your
                                        understanding and go ahead and study. Only then will you get the desired RESULTS
                                        So what am i trying to say?
                                        Man is a product of his DECISION.
                                        Because, the decisions a person makes shape their identity, experiences, and
                                        outcomes in life.
                                        üî∫I just wanted to open your EYES and be mindful of the decision you make in
                                        your life.

                                        In the bustling city of Lusaka, amidst the towering skyscrapers and bustling
                                        streets, there lived a young man named Michael. Unlike many of his peers who
                                        were drawn to the allure of quick riches and shortcuts to success, Michael
                                        believed in a different path. For him, success was not a gamble; it was a result
                                        of dedication, hard work, and the unwavering belief that he controlled his own
                                        destiny.

                                        As the CEO of Zed Chyna Plug Ventures, a burgeoning startup in the heart of
                                        Zambia, Michael exemplified these principles every day. From the moment he
                                        founded the company, he poured his heart and soul into building it from the
                                        ground up. Long hours spent in the office, late nights brainstorming strategies,
                                        and weekends sacrificed in pursuit of his vision ‚Äì Michael's dedication knew no
                                        bounds.

                                        But it wasn't just hard work that fueled Michael's journey; it was also his
                                        unwavering belief in himself and his team. Despite the challenges and setbacks
                                        that inevitably came his way, Michael never wavered in his conviction that they
                                        could overcome anything. He instilled this same belief in his employees,
                                        empowering them to strive for greatness and reach new heights together.

                                        As the years passed, Zed Chyna Plug Ventures grew from a small startup into a
                                        thriving business empire, thanks in no small part to Michael's leadership and
                                        vision. Along the way, he faced countless obstacles ‚Äì fierce competition,
                                        financial struggles, and moments of self-doubt ‚Äì but he never lost sight of his
                                        ultimate goal.

                                        For Michael, success was not just about achieving wealth or recognition; it was
                                        about proving to himself and the world that anything was possible with hard
                                        work, dedication, and belief in oneself. And as he stood atop the pinnacle of
                                        his achievements, looking out over the city he loved, Michael knew that his
                                        journey was far from over. With the same dedication and belief that had brought
                                        him this far, he was ready to conquer whatever challenges lay ahead, confident
                                        in the knowledge that he controlled his own destiny.

                                    </h5>

                                    <p class="card-text my-0 blog_story_half">
                                        Despite the presence of unkind souls in this world, we must remember that amidst
                                        the snakes and wolves, there are still innocent sheep deserving of a glimmer of
                                        kindness.
                                        In my own journey, I have come to realize the immense power of kindness. It has
                                        the ability to transform not only our own lives but also the lives of those
                                        around us. Even in the face of life-threatening situations, a few genuine acts
                                        of kindness have served as the lifeline that kept me going.
                                        Kindness has opened doors for me that I never thought possible. It has paved the
                                        way for my education, granting me a place in school and propelling me to where I
                                        am today. Without the kindness of those who extended their hand and showed me
                                        compassion when the world turned away, I wouldn't be in my fourth year of
                                        studies.
                                        You see, choosing kindness goes beyond mere nature or nurture. It is a conscious
                                        decision to make a positive impact on the lives of others. Through kindness, we
                                        have the incredible opportunity to save souls who may be on the brink of giving
                                        up on life.
                                        So, why choose kindness? Simply put, kindness has the power to create ripples of
                                        positive change in the world. It not only uplifts those who receive it but also
                                        inspires others to pay it forward. In a world that can sometimes be harsh and
                                        unkind, being a beacon of kindness can bring hope, healing, and restoration to
                                        the souls in need.
                                        Remember, amidst the chaos, there will always be space for acts of kindness. It
                                        is through these small and seemingly insignificant gestures that we can make a
                                        profound difference in the lives of others. So let us choose kindness, for it is
                                        a force that unites us, uplifts us, and creates a better world for all.

                                        Meet Emmanuel Nkole, owner of Young Phiroz!

                                        I am Zambian citizen by the name of Emmanuel Nkole, popularly known as YOUNG
                                        PHIROZ
                                        I was born on the 25th of December 199.. in Mpika, Northern Province in a family
                                        of 8, being the second from the last. I started my primary school at Chibwa
                                        Community School in Mpika district of Northern Province Zambia from 1996 to
                                        2001.
                                        I then went to Luchembe basic school were I underwent my junior secondary school
                                        from 2002 to 2003, in mpika. Thereafter, I went to mipka secondary school were I
                                        underwent my 10th to 12th grade till 2006. Despite being at school by that time,
                                        I also assisted my elder brother in running his business.
                                        After completing my senior secondary school level, my dreams were to study
                                        accountancy or mechanical engineering, but due to financial problems, my parents
                                        were unable to afford for my tertiary level. In 2007 I decided to travel to
                                        Lusaka to look for employments so that I could raise money for my education.
                                        After I came to Lusaka, I started staying with my friends whilst looking for
                                        jobs, unfortunately none was found. The same friends of mine that I came to stay
                                        with were selling plastic bags for a living. So I decided to join them in the
                                        sale of plastic bags in city market. The whole year in 2007, I sold plastic bags
                                        and saved every profit I made from it. I started with a capital of K10, 000 old
                                        currency by then, now being K10 rebased. The business was okay though it had
                                        some challenges such that it was difficult for me to gain trust from customers
                                        because they would think as if you are a thief and want to steal from them.
                                        I accepted the challenges because it‚Äôs known that everyone that sells plastic
                                        bags is considered to be a thief even by now that‚Äôs just the mindset that people
                                        have towards plastic sellers. But I didn‚Äôt give up because I knew what I wanted
                                        in life and I had faith that the outcome was going to be ok.
                                        In 2008, I managed to own a ‚Äòka ntemba‚Äô popularly called (chi gulu gulu) in the
                                        same market (city market) which was very ok for me. The challenge I faced while
                                        I owned a ka ntemba were that.; I would wake up as early as 04:00hrs and by
                                        05:00hrs I would be in the market to make displays and sell abit, then by 07:
                                        00hrs we used to pack all our goods because the city council were not allowing
                                        street vendors and then we only got to sell again at 17:30hrs after the council
                                        knock off. That was a big challenge because of the hours in between 7:00hrs to
                                        17:30hrs that we roamed around city market without selling and during rainy
                                        season I had no shelter which also became a challenge.
                                        Later at the end of 2008, I managed to open up a container shop from my little
                                        savings which was the best thing in my life, While on the container shop, I
                                        again faced some challenges of rental payments to the owner of the container
                                        cause when I was on the chi gulu gulu I only used to pay a small amount to the
                                        council.
                                        At the end of 2009, I managed to open up my first shop which I named YOUNG
                                        PHIROZ GENERAL DEALERS in city market. And by this it was my dream come true.
                                        The first challenge I faced after owing my first shop was rentals, from a
                                        container that I paid for a fair charge to a shop that I started paying a huge
                                        amount of money.
                                        Secondly the capital became a challenge because the shop needed to be stocked
                                        with more goods from time to time. Thirdly the workers started increasing in
                                        number then looking at the status I was in, I then decided to get a loan from
                                        Finca which was to be paid back in 12 months‚Äô time. Within 3 months, life and
                                        business stability changed to normal than before. And I managed to pay the whole
                                        amount within the estimated period of time through God‚Äôs grace and guidance.
                                        The other challenges I faced were that I started working with different people
                                        who had different motives and visions towards the business working setup. At
                                        times I would find myself in a situation where by I would send somebody for
                                        orders and that person would go just like that and never shows up again with the
                                        goods or the money. Others will get paid then the following day never shows up
                                        for work without informing me about the reason towards that which also was a
                                        challenge to look for a replacement on that person‚Äôs position and others never
                                        understood customer relationship, they never knew how to respond to their needs
                                        in a proper manner and it contributed to the challenges.
                                        In 2010, my business was much stable compared to the previous year with less
                                        challenges. With that I managed to open another shop in 2011, within city market
                                        though it came as a challenge to manage two shops at once as a proprietor. But
                                        later adapted to it after few months.
                                        In 2017, I decided to change the shopping strategy into a self-service store in
                                        mind of customers to be able to see and know what they are buying and that
                                        attracted more customers and it became the perfect movement for me and my
                                        business. And it made my business name to be known and recognized by a lot of
                                        customers, people within Lusaka and other provinces from then till now.
                                        Many people may be wondering to why I employ young vibrant youths it‚Äôs because;
                                        many school leavers who are still waiting for their results and some despite not
                                        attending any school levels but have abilities to work. By doing so, better to
                                        employ them to make their mind busy and for others to raise money to further
                                        their education if at all they are willing to rather than been home, meeting
                                        different people with different behavior‚Äôs, background so as to that, I try to
                                        do so to reduce frustration, peer pressure and the likes that lead to destroying
                                        young youths lives and involving themselves in beer drinking, drug abuse, theft
                                        to mention but a few. And also to help all those that have a vision of owing
                                        their own business I do teach them so that they can learn from me and be
                                        encouraged from my background.
                                        It‚Äôs not by obtaining PHDs, Degrees or Diplomas that make up life perfect. Hard
                                        work, self-discipline, perseverance, focus, patience and God‚Äôs guidance is what
                                        brings out the perfection in a person for a better tomorrow.
                                        Always remember that in every business there are ups and downs and as an
                                        entrepreneur you have to expect uncertainties that include damages, no business
                                        for a day or 2 or even for a month, less profit and more loses, even if the wind
                                        blows you backwards, just stand still and firm knowing such are expectations in
                                        business management.
                                        Start from small to bigger dreams, from zero to hero and from grass to grace not
                                        forgetting the almighty‚Äôs protection and guidance. From a plastic seller to a
                                        C.E.O of YOUNG PHIROZ GENERAL DEALERS, thank you for the pain it made me raise

                                        Everyday feels like a starting point for us. Don‚Äôt just be a dreamer, be an
                                        achiever as well. Don‚Äôt say you will do it tomorrow, do it today and don‚Äôt say
                                        you will do it later, do it now because today is yesterday‚Äôs tomorrow. Do what
                                        you can in the amount of time called life.
                                        God uplift‚Äôs those who humble themselves. Humble yourself before the lord and he
                                        will exalt you. Thank you.

                                        Dear Fresher
                                        Today next week, you'll be reporting for school embarking on a journey to change
                                        the very rail track of the train carrying your future.
                                        I would have said stay away from alcohol, drugs, explicit sexual activities and
                                        the like but I wouldn't be doing you justice because reality is one day you
                                        might succumb to these then what?? Moreover, studies have shown that telling
                                        someone not to do something motivates then even more to do it
                                        What I will talk about however is your goal and your priorities? What is your
                                        goal when going to school? To be connected? empower yourself?to learn new
                                        things?...well that's different with every individual but all of us go to
                                        university with the aim of getting the degree and advance our academia.
                                        Never forget that goal, you're leaving home to change home remember? otherwise
                                        you could've stayed home.
                                        You can party, you can drink, you can play but always keep the goal in mind and
                                        make it a priority. I have friends who would study and finish their assignments
                                        then go to the bar and come back at 4 in the morning only to wake up at 12 with
                                        a hangover, is that being playful? Yes but the priority was still in it's place.
                                        I also had friends who were novel fanatics so much that they forgot about their
                                        school books? Well, is reading a novel bad? No, it's a good thing but the
                                        priority is not in it's place here.
                                        Keep on changing methods of studying and learning and stick to ones that work, I
                                        will qoute Mathew Mohan who said you can your method but not your goal
                                        Set goals and priorities straight, it's not about what you do but how, when and
                                        how often you do it.
