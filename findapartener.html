                                            How Do I Know If It‚Äôs Real Love?

LOVE‚Äã‚Äîto starry-eyed romantics it is a mysterious visitation that seizes you, a once-in-a-lifetime feeling of sheer ecstasy. Love, they believe, is strictly an affair of the heart, something that cannot be understood, just experienced. Love conquers all and lasts forever . . .

So go the romantic clich√©s. And no doubt about it, falling in love can be a uniquely beautiful experience. But just what is real love?

Love at First Sight?

David met Janet for the first time at a party. He was immediately attracted to her shapely figure and the way her hair tumbled over her eye when she laughed. Janet was enchanted by his deep brown eyes and his witty conversation. It seemed like a case of mutual love at first sight!

During the next three weeks, David and Janet were inseparable. Then one night Janet received a devastating phone call from a former boyfriend. She called David for comfort. But David, feeling threatened and confused, responded coldly. The love they thought would last forever died that night.

Movies, books, and television shows would have you believe that love at first sight lasts forever. Granted, physical attractiveness is usually what makes two people  notice each other in the first place. As one young man put it: ‚ÄúIt is hard to ‚Äòsee‚Äô a person‚Äôs personality.‚Äù But what is it that one ‚Äúloves‚Äù when a relationship is but a few hours or days old? Is it not the image that person projects? Really, you don‚Äôt know much about that person‚Äôs thoughts, hopes, fears, plans, habits, skills, or abilities. You‚Äôve met only the outer shell, not ‚Äúthe secret person of the heart.‚Äù (1 Peter 3:4) How enduring could such love be?

Looks Are Deceiving

Furthermore, outward appearances can be deceiving. The Bible says: ‚ÄúCharm may be false, and prettiness may be vain.‚Äù The glittering wrappings of a gift tell you nothing of what‚Äôs inside. In fact, the most elegant wrappings may cover a useless gift.‚Äã‚ÄîProverbs 31:30.

The Proverbs say: ‚ÄúAs a gold nose ring in the snout of a pig, so is a woman that is pretty but that is turning away from sensibleness.‚Äù (Proverbs 11:22) Nose rings were a popular adornment during Bible times. They were exquisite, often made of solid gold. Naturally, such a ring would be the first piece of jewelry you would notice on a woman.

Appropriately, the proverb compares an outwardly beautiful woman who lacks ‚Äúsensibleness‚Äù to a ‚Äúnose ring in the snout of a pig.‚Äù Beauty simply does not befit  a senseless woman; it is a useless ornament on her. In the long run, it no more makes her appealing than would a gorgeous nose ring beautify a pig! What a mistake it is, then, to fall ‚Äòin love‚Äô with the way someone looks‚Äã‚Äîand ignore what that person is inside.

‚ÄúThe Most Deceitful Thing There Is‚Äù

Some, however, feel that the human heart has infallible romantic judgment. ‚ÄòJust listen to your heart,‚Äô they argue. ‚ÄòYou will know when it‚Äôs real love!‚Äô Unfortunately, the facts contradict this notion. A survey was taken in which 1,079 young people (ages 18 to 24) reported having experienced an average of seven romantic involvements up to that time. Most admitted that their past romances were mere infatuation‚Äã‚Äîa passing, fading emotion. Yet, these youths ‚Äúinvariably described their current experience as love‚Äù! Most, though, will likely one day view their current involvements as they did their past ones‚Äã‚Äîas mere infatuations.

The tragedy is that thousands of couples every year marry under the illusion of being ‚Äòin love,‚Äô only to find shortly thereafter that they have seriously erred. Infatuation ‚Äúlures unsuspecting men and women into poor marriages like lambs to the slaughter,‚Äù says Ray Short in his book Sex, Love, or Infatuation.

‚ÄúHe that is trusting in his own heart is stupid.‚Äù (Proverbs 28:26) Far too often, the judgment of our  heart is misguided or misdirected. In fact, the Bible says: ‚ÄúThe heart is the most deceitful thing there is.‚Äù (Jeremiah 17:9, The Living Bible) Yet, the aforementioned proverb continues: ‚ÄúBut he that is walking in wisdom is the one that will escape.‚Äù You too can escape the dangers and frustrations other youths have suffered if you learn the difference between infatuation and the love described in the Bible‚Äã‚Äîthe love that never fails.

 Love Versus Infatuation

‚ÄúInfatuation is blind and it likes to stay that way. It doesn‚Äôt like to look at reality,‚Äù admits 24-year-old Calvin. A 16-year-old girl, Kenya, added, ‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre infatuated with a person, you think that everything they do is just perfect.‚Äù

Infatuation is counterfeit love. It is unrealistic and self-centered. Infatuated persons have a tendency to say: ‚ÄòI really feel important when I‚Äôm with him. I can‚Äôt sleep. I can‚Äôt believe how fantastic this is‚Äô or, ‚ÄòShe really makes me feel good.‚Äô Notice how many times either ‚ÄúI‚Äù or ‚Äúme‚Äù is used? A relationship based on selfishness is bound to fail! Note, however, the Bible‚Äôs description of true love: ‚ÄúLove is long-suffering and kind. Love is not jealous, it does not brag, does not get puffed up, does not behave indecently, does not look for its own interests, does not become provoked. It does not keep account of the injury.‚Äù‚Äã‚Äî1 Corinthians 13:4, 5.

Since it ‚Äúdoes not look for its own interests,‚Äù love based on Bible principle is neither self-centered nor selfish. True, a couple may have strong romantic feelings and mutual attraction. But these feelings are balanced by reason and deep respect for the other person.  When you are really in love, you care just as much for the other person‚Äôs welfare and happiness as you do for your own. You do not let overpowering emotion destroy good judgment.

An Example of Real Love

The Bible account of Jacob and Rachel vividly illustrates this. This couple met at a well where Rachel had come to water her father‚Äôs sheep. Jacob was immediately attracted to her not only because she was ‚Äúbeautiful in form and beautiful of countenance‚Äù but because she was a worshiper of Jehovah.‚Äã‚ÄîGenesis 29:1-12, 17.

After spending a full month living in the home of Rachel‚Äôs family, Jacob made it known that he was in love with Rachel and wanted to marry her. Mere romantic infatuation? Not at all! During that month, he had seen Rachel in her natural setting‚Äã‚Äîhow she treated her parents and others, how she went about her work as a shepherdess, how seriously she took Jehovah‚Äôs worship. Undoubtedly he saw her at both her ‚Äúbest‚Äù and her ‚Äúworst.‚Äù His love for her was therefore not unbridled emotion but an unselfish love based on reason and deep respect.

Such being the case, Jacob could declare that he was willing to work for her father seven years to be able to have her as a wife. Certainly no infatuation would have lasted that long! Only genuine love, an unselfish interest in the other, would have made those years seem ‚Äúlike some few days.‚Äù Because of that genuine love, they were able to maintain their chastity during that period.‚Äã‚ÄîGenesis 29:20, 21.

 It Takes Time!

True love is therefore not hurt by time. Indeed, often the best way to test out your feelings for someone is to let some time pass. Furthermore, as a young woman named Sandra observed: ‚ÄúA person just doesn‚Äôt hand out to you his personality by simply saying: ‚ÄòThis is what I am. Now you know all about me.‚Äô‚Äù No, it also takes time to get to know someone you are interested in.

Time also allows you to examine your romantic interest in the light of the Bible. Remember, love ‚Äúdoes not behave indecently, does not look for its own interests.‚Äù Is your companion eager for the success of your plans‚Äã‚Äîor only for his or her own? Does he or she show respect for your viewpoint, your feelings? Has he or she pressured you to do things that are really ‚Äòindecent‚Äô in order to satisfy selfish passions? Does this person tend to put you down or build you up in front of others? Asking questions like these can help you appraise your feelings more objectively.

Rushing romance invites disaster. ‚ÄúI just fell in love, fast and deep,‚Äù explained 20-year-old Jill. After a whirlwind romance of two months, she married. But previously concealed faults began to emerge. Jill began to display some of her insecurity and self-centeredness. Her husband, Rick, lost his romantic charm and became selfish. After being married for about two years, Jill one day screamed that her husband was ‚Äúcheap,‚Äù ‚Äúlazy,‚Äù and a ‚Äúflop‚Äù as a husband. Rick responded by striking her in the face with his fist. In tears, Jill dashed out of their house‚Äã‚Äîand out of their marriage.

Following the Bible‚Äôs counsel would no doubt have  helped them preserve their marriage. (Ephesians 5:22-33) But how different things might have been had they become better acquainted with each other before marriage! Their love would have been not of an ‚Äúimage‚Äù but of a real personality‚Äã‚Äîone with both flaws and strengths. Their expectations would have been more realistic.

Real love does not happen overnight. Nor is the person who would make you a good marriage mate necessarily someone you find overwhelmingly attractive. Barbara, for example, met a young man whom she admits she was not overly attracted to‚Äã‚Äîat first. ‚ÄúBut as I got to know him better,‚Äù recalls Barbara, ‚Äúthings changed. I saw Stephen‚Äôs concern for other people and how he always put the interests of others before himself. These were the qualities I knew would make a good husband. I was drawn to him and began to love him.‚Äù A solid marriage resulted.

So how can you know true love? Your heart may speak, but trust your Bible-trained mind. Get to know more than the person‚Äôs external ‚Äúimage.‚Äù Give the relationship time to blossom. Remember, infatuation reaches a fever pitch in a short time but then fades. Genuine love grows stronger with time and becomes ‚Äúa perfect bond of union.‚Äù‚Äã‚ÄîColossians 3:14.
