                I Just slept with my cousins mom and I have 3 girlfriends who don't know I have very bad STI's and HIV, its fatal for me unfortunately, I might die soon but I will keep spreading this because I can't go alone. sorry in advance
                I'm sorry to some of my girls from Lusemfwa hostel it's better for me to apologize here than in person because I know the results won't be good...but tbh they're only 3 I had one night stands with
                keep me in your prayers but I'm too distressed to feel this pain alone
