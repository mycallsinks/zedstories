Am a Zambian citizen by the name of Emmanuel Nkole, popularly known as YOUNG PHIROZ
I was born on the 25th of December 199.. in mpika, Northern Province. In a family of 8 been the second from the last. I started my primary school at chibwa community school in mpika district of Northern Province Zambia from 1996 to 2001.
I then went to luchembe basic school were I underwent my junior secondary school from 2002 to 2003, in mpika. Thereafter, I went to mipka secondary school were I underwent my 10th to 12th grade till 2006. Despite being at school by that time, I also assisted my elder brother in running his business. 
After completing my senior secondary school level, my dreams were to study accountancy or mechanical engineering. But due to financial problems, my parents were unable to afford for my tertiary level. In 2007 I decided to travel to Lusaka to look for employments so that I could raise money for my education.
After I came to Lusaka, I started staying with my friends whilst looking for jobs, unfortunately none was found. The same friends of mine that I came to stay with were selling plastic bags for a living. So I decided to join them in the sale of plastic bags in city market. The whole year in 2007, I sold plastic bags and saved every profit I made from it. I started with a capital of k10, 000 old currency by then, now been k10 rebased. The business was okay though it had some challenges such that it was difficult for me to gain trust from customers because they would think as if you are a thief and want to steal from them. I accepted the challenges because it’s known that everyone that sells plastic bags is considered to be a thief even by now that’s just the mindset that people have towards plastic sellers. But I didn’t give up because I knew what I wanted in life and I had faith that the outcome was going to be ok.
In 2008, I managed to own a ‘ka ntemba’ popularly called (chi gulu gulu) in the same market (city market) which was very ok for me. The challenge I faced while I owned a ka ntemba were that.; I would wake up as early as 04:00hrs and by 05:00hrs I would be in the market to make displays and sell abit, then by 07: 00hrs we used to pack all our goods because the city council were not allowing street vendors and then we only got to sell again at 17:30hrs after the council knock off. That was a big challenge because of the hours in between 7:00hrs to 17:30hrs that we roamed around city market without selling and during rainy season I had no shelter which also became a challenge.
Later at the end of 2008, I managed to open up a container shop from my little savings which was the best thing in my life, While on the container shop, I again faced some challenges of rental payments to the owner of the container cause when I was on the chi gulu gulu I only used to pay a small amount to the council.
At the end of 2009, I managed to open up my first shop which I named YOUNG PHIROZ GENERAL DEALERS in city market. And by this it was my dream come true. The first challenge I faced after owing my first shop was rentals, from a container that I paid for a fair charge to a shop that I started paying a huge amount of money. Secondly the capital became a challenge because the shop needed to be stocked with more goods from time to time. Thirdly the workers started increasing in number then looking at the status I was in, I then decided to get a loan from Finca which was to be paid back in 12 months’ time. Within 3 months, life and business stability changed to normal than before. And I managed to pay the whole amount within the estimated period of time through God’s grace and guidance. The other challenges I faced were that I started working with different people who had different motives and visions towards the business working setup. At times I would find myself in a situation where by I would send somebody for orders and that person would go just like that and never shows up again with the goods or the money. Others will get paid then the following day never shows up for work without informing me about the reason towards that which also was a challenge to look for a replacement on that person’s position  and others never understood customer relationship, they never knew how to respond to their needs in a proper manner and it contributed to the challenges.
In 2010, my business was much stable compared to the previous year with less challenges. With that I managed to open another shop in 2011, within city market though it came as a challenge to manage two shops at once as a proprietor. But later adapted to it after few months.
In 2017, I decided to change the shopping strategy into a self-service store in mind of customers to be able to see and know what they are buying and that attracted more customers and it became the perfect movement for me and my business. And it made my business name to be known and recognized by a lot of customers, people within Lusaka and other provinces from then till now. 
 Many people in maybe wondering  to why I employ young vibrant youths it’s because; many school leavers who are still waiting for their results and some despite not attending any school levels but have abilities to work. By doing so, better to employ them to make their mind busy and for others to raise money to further their education if at all they are willing to rather than been home, meeting different people with different behavior’s, background so as to that, I try to do so to reduce frustration, peer pressure and the likes that lead to destroying young youths lives and involving themselves in beer drinking, drug abuse, theft to mention but a few. And also to help all those that have a vision of owing their own business I do teach them so that they can learn from me and be encouraged from my background. 
It’s not by obtaining PHDs, Degrees or Diplomas that make up life perfect. Hard work, self-discipline, perseverance, focus, patience and God’s guidance is what brings out the perfection in a person for a better tomorrow.   
Always remember that in every business there are ups and downs and as an entrepreneur you have to expect uncertainties that include damages, no business for a day or 2 or even for a month, less profit and more loses, even if the wind blows you backwards, just stand still and firm knowing such are expectations in business management.
Start from small to bigger dreams, from zero to hero and from grass to grace not forgetting the almighty’s protection and guidance. From a plastic seller to a C.E.O of YOUNG PHIROZ GENERAL DEALERS, thank you for the pain it made me raise my game, “DREAM CHASER”.
Special thanks goes to; The Almighty God for his endless love, guidance and protection, my dearest family, workers, friends , our suppliers, wholesalers and other supportive companies   you the best !!!  not forgetting our loving customers, thank you for your endless love and support.
Everyday feels like a starting point for us. Don’t just be a dreamer, be an achiever as well. Don’t say you will do it tomorrow, do it today and don’t say you will do it later, do it now because today is yesterday’s tomorrow. Do what you can in the amount of time called life.
God uplift’s those who humble themselves. Humble yourself before the lord and he will exalt you. Thank you.

If you have to be successful in this world, you have to follow your passion.
In entrepreneurship you don’t necessarily have to be passionate about “what” you’re selling, you can be passionate about just starting a business or being self-employed. I just wanted to be an entrepreneur, I was passionate about succeeding, I wanted to be a successful business owner so the many things I engaged in were just means to this end.
I learnt that a certain type of Motorbikes were cheap in Mozambique. I embarked on a journey on 13th March, 2011 via Chanida Border to Tete town which is about 400Kms into Mozambique. I surely found Motorbikes fetching much less there, I then got one. After some calculations I learnt that I could make a saving if I rode the Motorbike to Chanida Border instead of putting it in a truck or bus. Unfortunately, I did not know how to ride, so I requested one of the shop attendants to teach and ride me to a road leading to Zambia. I observed him along the way, by the time we got to the road leading to Zambia I had become confident to risky learning and riding all the way back to Zambia. After fuelling and putting some backup petrol in a container, I embarked on a journey back home. Initially I had difficulties mastering gears but after about 50Kms, I had become a better rider and got excited knowing that my determination was paying off. Looking back I think it was just a crazy decision made by a 21 year old because how else can I explain one learning to ride a motorbike in a foreign country, no license, no experience, first time getting in that country with language barrier as they use Portuguese there.
Alas after covering 204Kms the bike broke in the middle of nowhere, oil leaked out and a certain engine cover had broken. I was really stuck passed 22hours, I had no mechanical idea on bikes for I had just learnt how to ride, no network and no homes or forms of civilization around the area. I pushed the bike on the side of the road and used the helmet as a pillow by the roadside grass with no covering, no food and no means of contacting any human being except hoping for any vehicle to come to my rescue. As I lay on the grass with my head on the helmet gazing in the dark sky surrounded by jungle horror movie kind of sounds, inwardly I had so much peace because my passion for business was by far outweighing the hardship and worry I was subjected to. When I realized that no vehicle was stopping to my rescue, I decided to start pushing the Motorbike as I walked back to Zambia. Just after midnight a bus stopped by to give me a lift. What surprised me was the hastiness they loaded my bike with, like people who are robbing a bank. The words the driver said as we started off are still vivid in my mind, he said “Young boy you should always be praising your God for sustaining your life, as you can see there are no habitants in this stretch of over 100Kms because of wild animals.” He continued saying “There are lions, leopards, hyenas, snakes and many other dangerous wild animals, you could have been eaten up without trace.”
Looking back I think I was just passionate about entrepreneurship to the point of risking my life, and I don’t regret every bit I went through. People that have made a significant difference and mark in this world are people who pursued their passions whole heartedly. Do an introspection today, you have to identify and know your passion otherwise your life will just be an ordinary one. 
Passion is priceless.

                    I have fought many battles,  amongst the big ones are Poverty and Stammering. Those who remember my Primary and Secondary School  days can attest to the fact that I could hardly say words and worse complete a sentence. I remember a couple of times tears rolling down my cheeks due to stammering especially when explaining or arguing. How I stopped stammering is a story for another day, all I can say it was by God's grace. 
                    Eleven years ago in 2008 after fighting the humiliation, embarrassment and low self esteem that comes with stammering for over 15years I showed signs of a potential speaker. I had so much joy to learn that I could finish a full sentence without stammering, this gave birth to my deep passion for speaking. I worked extremely hard to build my newly found passion of speaking such that the year that followed I pushed my way as a free Motivational Speaker at the graduation ceremony at ZIBSIP College on 25th September, 2009. The speech cemented that I can speak without stammering if i pushed a little harder because I spoke for over 10minutes without stammering. 
                    Since then I worked on my newly found passion. It was all for free long before I thought I could be paid to speak, worse to even dream of being paid up to $5000 (K61,000) to speak for 2hour sessions at most international conferences I have been invited to speak. This is in addition to my travelling,  accommodation and other incidental costs. 
                    Follow your passion the pay cheque is on the way......
